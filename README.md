# Team Moon

With only ***two members*** on the board, we were able to achieve to make a full-stack project within 2 days. We have completely deployed our backend and on the frontend side, we build an Android App.


## Team Moon API
Team Moon API (CRUD) is made using Express and MongoDB and fully deployed on Deta. It is used for taking notes. we can do operations like Reading, Writing, Deleting, and Editing the data.

## Frontend (To-do App)

**On the frontend side, we developed an Android App to make it more usable, even for a person who has Zero code knowledge. Tech Stacks we used:**
